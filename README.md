# Machine Learning Model for Predicting Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH)

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) using supervised machine learning methods.  
The dataset includes maternal health indicators, and the goal is to evaluate how well different ML models can classify PPH risk.

## Workflow
- Data loading and cleaning
- Feature preprocessing and encoding
- Train/Test split with stratification
- Model training:
  - XGBoost
  - Random Forest 
- Performance evaluation:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion matrix (generated at runtime)

## Purpose
This project is part of my ongoing collaboration with a senior lecturer on applying machine learning techniques to maternal health research.  
It serves as an introduction to healthcare-focused ML workflows.

## Tools Used
Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
